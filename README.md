Yet Another Castlewars Clone

How to play:

Left-click card to play it, discard it with right-click and then right-click in the green area to confirm.
You can define how many cards may be discarded in each turn in the top section of the code. (there, you can also define various other game constants)

If you enable pass-moves, right-click on player-indicator (top-center of screen) to pass your move.
If computer seemed to not make a move, it either discarded or (if you enabled it) passed a move.
